YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization format. It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted. YAML uses indentation to represent data structures and relationships between elements.

Key features and usage of YAML:
1. Configuration files: Used in many applications and tools for storing settings.
2. Data exchange: Facilitates data transfer between different systems or programming languages.
3. Data storage: Can be used to store structured data in a readable format.
4. DevOps and Infrastructure as Code: Widely used in tools like Ansible, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes for defining infrastructure and deployments.
5. API documentation: Often used in tools like Swagger for describing RESTful APIs.

YAML is popular due to its simplicity, readability, and ability to represent complex data structures in a clear, hierarchical manner.



Differences between XML, JSON, and YAML for data storage:

| Feature           | XML                      | JSON                     | YAML                     |
|-------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Readability       | Less readable            | Moderately readable      | Highly readable          |
| Complexity        | More complex             | Less complex             | Least complex            |
| Data types        | Limited built-in types   | Supports common types    | Supports complex types   |
| Metadata support  | Excellent                | Limited                  | Good                     |
| Parsing speed     | Slower                   | Fast                     | Moderate                 |
